	<h1>Simulatory</h1>
	<p width = 20%>Here are some examples of my work. It's mostly some simple physics simulations along with a couple tools made to help with
		various tasks. All the examples are made from scratch using HTML and JavaScript, although additions later on might use WebGL to help
		with 3D modeling.</p>
